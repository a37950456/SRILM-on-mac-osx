B. Download srilm  (I use srilm-1.7.2)

1. Find Makefile folder under srilm-1.7.2

Find the row:

```
2. Change /Users/xxx/srilm-1.7.2/common /Makefile.machine.macosx file

Find
```cmd
CC = cc $(GCC_FLAGS) 
CXX = c++ $(GCC_FLAGS) -DINSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES
```
Change to
```cmd
CC = /usr/bin/gcc $(GCC_FLAGS) 
CXX = /usr/bin/g++ $(GCC_FLAGS) -DINSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES 
```
Find
```cmd
TCL_INCLUDE = -I/usr/include 
TCL_LIBRARY = -L/usr/lib -ltcl 
```
Change to
```cmd
TCL_INCLUDE = -I/usr/include 
TCL_LIBRARY = /usr/lib/libtcl8.5.dylib 
NO_TCL = X
```
Find
